## 🧪 Sample Code Snippet

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import cv2

def extract_skin(image):
    # Convert image to HSV and apply skin color mask
    hsv = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)
    lower = (0, 48, 80)
    upper = (20, 255, 255)
    skin_mask = cv2.inRange(hsv, lower, upper)
    return cv2.bitwise_and(image, image, mask=skin_mask)
```
